# ERC-20 Token Smart Contract
This project focuses on developing a basic ERC-20 Token Smart Contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The goal is to create a simple token that follows the ERC-20 standard, which is widely used for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum-based platforms. The project allows users to issue and transfer tokens on the blockchain, simulating a real-world token economy.
